Use this template to document the plan BEFORE execution begins. This document:
- Serves as proof for the client
- Is the reference throughout the project
- Acts as fallback if task system fails
- Can be updated iteratively (versioned)

## Usage in DECOMPOSE Phase

When decomposing tasks, **T-000 is always first**:

```yaml
tasks:
  - id: T-000
    description: "Create session plan document"
    deliverable: ".project/plans/PLAN-{date}-{slug}.md"
    depends_on: []
    gate: 🟢
    effort: "0h (part of CONTRACT phase)"
    note: "This document is created during CONTRACT, before approval"

  - id: T-001
    description: "[First real task]"
    depends_on: [T-000]  # All tasks depend on plan existing
    ...
```

---

## Integration with Contract

The CONTRACT phase now includes:

1. **Create plan document** (T-000)
2. **Present contract** (summary of plan)
3. **Wait for approval**
4. **Update plan with approval record**
5. **Begin execution**

The plan document IS the contract, just in full detail.
